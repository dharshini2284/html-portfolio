<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. 
  I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise 
  in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming 
  from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep 
  in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, 
  I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country's peace, I like metropolis' noise; 
  I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; 
  I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.</p>

<p>My strengths are- I am loyal to my work, and I have good communication skills. I'm an optimistic person ability to learn, 
  a Team player, and a positive mind & self-motivated & hard-working person towards my career and my life.</p>
